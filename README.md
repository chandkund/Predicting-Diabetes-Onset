 # Predicting Diabetes Onset 🩺💡

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the onset of diabetes using various machine learning models. The goal is to develop a predictive model based on health-related features to determine the likelihood of diabetes.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies  🤰
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration (2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test)  🩸 
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  💉
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)  📏
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)  🧪
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) ⚖️
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A measure of likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the individual (years)  🎂
- **Outcome**: Whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0) ✅❌

## Models Used
- **GaussianNB**
- **DecisionTreeClassifier**
- **RandomForestClassifier**
- **LogisticRegression**
- **AdaBoostClassifier**
- **XGBClassifier**
- **SVC**
- **GradientBoostingClassifier**
- **Neural Network**

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:
- pandas  📜
